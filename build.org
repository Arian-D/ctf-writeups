#+startup: fold

This file is called by [[./flake.nix]] to build the website. Prior to
getting here, Nix has to provide the dependecies which are:
- Emacs
- Ox-hugo
- Hugo

* Org setup
=ob= needs =shell= to be amongst the executable langauges.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((shell . t)))
#+end_src

* Org to markdown
For all the org files run =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  ;; TODO: Do it recursively instead once there are more directories
  (dolist (file (directory-files "./overthewire/" t ".org"))
    (with-current-buffer (find-file file)
      (org-hugo-export-wim-to-md)))
#+end_src

* markdown to hugo
This is the final step during build to compile the website.
#+begin_src shell :results silent
  hugo --minify
#+end_src
